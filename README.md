# Build Your Own Redis - Go Implementation

Welcome to the **Build Your Own Redis - Go Implementation** repository. This project is my implementation of a simple Redis clone using Go. It involves creating functionality for basic Redis commands, including `PING`, `SET`, and `GET`, while also exploring concepts such as event loops and the Redis protocol.

## Getting Started

To run your Redis server, make sure you have Go version 1.19 or newer installed, and then execute your custom script:
```sh
./your_program.sh
```
